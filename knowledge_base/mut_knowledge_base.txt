=== 3. INTER‑UNIVERSITY COMPARISONS ===

*Tuition per semester for similar Bachelor’s programmes:*

| Course / Institution                                    | MUT (BBIT) | Masinde Muliro US&T | Multimedia University (MUK) |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Bachelor of Business & IT / Comp. Sci                   | KSh 66,300 | ~KSh 50,000–65,000   | ~KSh 68,000–74,403           |
| Bachelor of Education (Science)                         | 2× KSh 122,400/year | BSc (Math & IT): KSh 100,000 | BSc Renewable En. Tech: KSh 68,000/sem :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |

**Key points:**
- MUT's *BBIT* fee (~KSh 66,300) aligns with sector averages (Masinde, MUK).
- MUT's *B.Ed. Science* annual cost (~KSh 245,000) compares to MUK’s BSc (~KSh 68,000 per semester), and MMUST BSc programmes (~KSh 100,000 per year) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
- MUT UG fees are competitive but include extra levies (lab, QA, KUCCPS, etc.), leading to broader total costs.

These insights support model training on tuition benchmarks across Kenyan universities, reflecting variances by school, programme delivery and student funding source.
